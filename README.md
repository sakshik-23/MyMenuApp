# MyMenuApp
Created a Menu Bar using Java Swing. I have added a Manu Bar to the frame and accordingly added four different GUI components of Swing such as accepting data from user, setting colour for a particular area, tictactoe game and retrieving data from a text file and displaying it using JTable component. Please find the video of the output and working of this project in the uploaded files.
